# Crisis dashboard

This is a presentation describing the Crisis Dashboard, an idea that came from
the April Leeds City Council innovation lab.

The presentation can be viewed here: <https://fishpercolator.co.uk/presentations/crisis-dashboard/>

## Introduction

Crisis Dashboard is a small web application targeted at victims of abuse, that
can be hidden inside an Android mobile phone game.

The game would look exactly like one available in the Google Play Store, but
would have an additional secret code for accessing the dashboard.

It would be spread through word of mouth by teachers, support workers and former
victims at schools and children's centres.

## The dashboard

In its initial incarnation, the dashboard would serve two main purposes:

1. Providing signposting information to the victim (for example, numbers to
call)
2. Allowing the victim to send an alert with an optional short message to be
entered into a council or police monitoring system.

The recipient could then triage the messages and decide how best to respond.

**There is a semi-functional mockup of the dashboard on slide 8.** Feel free to play around with it.

## Future

After this initial version, many more features could be added into the
dashboard. For example, a live chat with a 999 agent, or a place to store plans
and documents for getting to safety.

It's also possible this same technology could be used to make triggers in
innocuous objects such as chapsticks, using IoT techniques.
